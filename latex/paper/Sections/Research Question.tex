\section{Research Question}
Based on the literature mentioned in the previous chapter, we aim to contribute to the field by assessing, whether \citeauthor{anderson_cheng_2016}'s proposed approach yields superior results in times of extreme events, such as the Great Financial Crisis of 2009 or the equity sell-off following the Covid-19 related shutdowns in 2020. We do so by extending \citeauthor{anderson_cheng_2016}'s scope to all permanent constitutes of the S&P 500 from 01/01/2005 to 10/16/2020.\\
Therefore, we aim to answer the following research question:\\

\centerline{\emph{Can \citetitle{anderson_cheng_2016} yield superior returns}}
\centerline{\emph{in an environment of extreme financial markets?}}
